	<p>I am currently a student at Fordham University, but my hometown is in Fairfax, VA, which is why I am taking summer classes at GMU this semester. However, prior to attending Fordham, I went to school at Case Western Reserve University.</p>
	<p>My educational journey has been a bit unconventional, but I am committed to reaching my goals and striving for success in any place I may end up.</p>
